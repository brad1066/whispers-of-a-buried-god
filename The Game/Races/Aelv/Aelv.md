The Aelv are a pointed-eared race, typically slightly shorter, more lightly built than humans.
Aelv have an innate sense of magic, and largely live more in harmony with nature than the other species. 
All Aelv live much longer lives than any of the other species, up near their second century. This invariably causes Aelv to develop an obsession over a particular thing, only to be discarded for the next.

Age: Aelv are between 20 and 100 years of age Aelves are typically really old which is part of the appeal. Can we change to 40-500.
Languages: Aelv speak Common and Aelvn
Faith of the Aelvn: Aelvs may not choose the Cleric or Penitent Class
Fey Kind: Aelvs are not a people of cities, stone walls and demarcations. Other species are Suspicious of you when you first meet them
Magic Awareness: all Aelv have the Sense Magic talent think this should be a trait you can’t get by just taking a talent. Makes them unique
